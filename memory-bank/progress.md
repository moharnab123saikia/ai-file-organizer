### Evolution of Project Decisions

#### Architecture Decisions That Worked Well
1. **Service-First Approach**: Building core business logic before UI proved effective
2. **TDD Methodology**: Test-first development prevented bugs and improved design
3. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Caught many potential runtime errors at compile time
4. **Configuration-Driven Design**: Makes the system flexible and extensible

#### Lessons Learned
1. **Mock Strategy**: Effective mocking patterns enable isolated unit testing
2. **Async Patterns**: Consistent async/await usage improves code readability
3. **Error Handling**: Structured error types improve debugging and user experience
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs prevent confusion during development

#### Successful Patterns to Continue
- **Test Structure**: Grouped by functionality with clear naming
- **Service Interfaces**: Clean contracts between system layers
- **Type Safety**: No compromises on type safety for rapid development
- **Progressive Development**: Build and test one layer at a time
