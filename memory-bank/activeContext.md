# AI File Organizer - Active Context

## Current Work Focus: Johnny Decimal Organization Engine Complete ✅

### Recently Completed (January 8, 2025)
**Major Milestone**: Complete implementation of Johnny Decimal Organization Engine with comprehensive TDD

#### Key Achievements:
1. **Full Implementation** (557 lines):
   - Complete Johnny Decimal system with areas (10, 20, 30...), categories (11, 12, 13...), items (11.01, 11.02...)
   - Configuration management with customizable limits and conflict resolution
   - AI suggestion processing for automatic file organization  
   - Session management with progress tracking and operation logging
   - Async validation with file existence checking and orphaned file detection
   - Export capabilities in JSON and Markdown formats

2. **Comprehensive Test Suite** (28 tests):
   - Constructor and configuration testing
   - Structure creation and manipulation validation
   - Area, category, and item management workflows
   - File organization automation with AI suggestions
   - Validation logic covering errors, warnings, and edge cases
   - Export functionality verification
   - Error handling and boundary condition testing

3. **TDD Success**: All 28 tests passing ✅ with 100% functionality coverage

### Technical Decisions Made

#### Johnny Decimal Number Generation
- **Areas**: Sequential multiples of 10 (10, 20, 30...)
- **Categories**: Area number + sequential increment (11, 12, 13... for area 10)
- **Items**: Category.padded_sequence (11.01, 11.02, 11.03...)

#### Configuration Strategy
```typescript
interface JohnnyDecimalConfiguration {
  maxAreas: number;                    // Default: 10
  maxCategoriesPerArea: number;        // Default: 10  
  maxItemsPerCategory: number;         // Default: 100
  autoCreateStructure: boolean;        // Default: true
  conflictResolution: 'rename' | 'merge' | 'skip';
}
```

#### AI Integration Approach
- Process `FileOrganizationSuggestion[]` from AI services
- Parse category suggestions like "10-19 Administration" and "12 Invoices"
- Automatic area/category creation when `autoCreateStructure: true`
- Confidence-based decision making for organization placement

#### Session Management Pattern
```typescript
interface OrganizationSession {
  id: string;
  status: SessionStatus;
  progress: SessionProgress;
  operations: OrganizationOperation[];
  settings: OrganizationSettings;
}
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority: React UI Components with TDD
**Goal**: Begin comprehensive React component implementation following established TDD patterns

#### Component Development Order:
1. **TreeView Component** - Hierarchical file/folder display
   - File system tree visualization
   - Collapsible/expandable nodes
   - File type icons and metadata display
   - Selection and interaction handlers

2. **OrganizationPanel Component** - AI suggestions interface
   - Display AI-generated organization suggestions
   - Interactive approval/rejection of suggestions
   - Real-time preview of proposed changes
   - Confidence indicators and reasoning display

3. **ProgressIndicator Component** - Operation feedback
   - Real-time progress bars for long operations
   - Status messages and error handling
   - Cancellation capabilities
   - Throughput and ETA calculations

4. **SettingsPanel Component** - Configuration management
   - AI model selection and configuration
   - Johnny Decimal preferences
   - File filtering options
   - Performance tuning controls

### Development Approach
- **Test-First**: Write comprehensive component tests before implementation
- **Component Testing**: React Testing Library for user interaction testing
- **Mock Integration**: Mock service layer for isolated component testing
- **Accessibility**: Ensure WCAG compliance from the start
- **Performance**: Optimize for large file structures with virtualization

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### UI Architecture Patterns
- **State Management**: React hooks with Context API for shared state
- **Component Structure**: Atomic design with clear separation of concerns
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistency
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography

### Testing Strategy for Components
```typescript
// Component test structure pattern
describe('TreeView', () => {
  describe('rendering', () => { /* visual tests */ });
  describe('interactions', () => { /* user behavior tests */ });
  describe('performance', () => { /* large data tests */ });
  describe('accessibility', () => { /* a11y tests */ });
});
```

### Integration Considerations
- **Service Integration**: Clean interfaces between UI and service layer
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling for robust UX
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators for async operations
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layout for different window sizes

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### TDD Methodology Established ✅
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Proven cycle working effectively
- **Test Coverage**: Maintaining >95% coverage across all modules
- **Mock Strategy**: Effective service mocking for isolated testing
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage preventing runtime errors

### Service Layer Architecture ✅
- **FileScanner**: Robust directory scanning with metadata extraction
- **OllamaService**: Reliable AI integration with error handling
- **JohnnyDecimalEngine**: Complete organization system implementation
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined contracts between services

### Development Workflow ✅
- **Build System**: Vite + Tauri configuration optimized
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest providing excellent developer experience
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier maintaining consistency
- **Version Control**: Git with conventional commits

## Current Learning and Project Insights

### TDD Effectiveness
- **Fast Feedback**: Tests provide immediate validation of implementation
- **Design Quality**: Test-first approach leads to better API design
- **Refactoring Confidence**: Comprehensive tests enable safe refactoring
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of intended behavior

### Johnny Decimal System Implementation
- **Flexibility**: Configuration-driven approach accommodates different organizational needs
- **Scalability**: Hierarchical structure handles large file collections efficiently
- **AI Integration**: Natural mapping between AI suggestions and structured organization
- **User Experience**: Clear numbering system provides intuitive navigation

### TypeScript Benefits
- **Compile-time Safety**: Catch errors before runtime
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent IDE support with autocompletion
- **Refactoring**: Safe automated refactoring across large codebase
- **Documentation**: Types serve as contract documentation

## Next Session Preparation

### Files to Review
- Component architecture guidelines in `docs/`
- Existing type definitions in `src/types/`
- Test setup and patterns in `src/test/`
- Service implementations for integration reference

### Environment Setup Verification
- Verify all dependencies are current
- Ensure test runner configuration is optimal
- Check build system performance
- Validate development server setup

The foundation is solid and comprehensive. Ready to begin React component development with the same rigorous TDD approach that has proven successful for the service layer.
